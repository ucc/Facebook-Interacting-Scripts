Terrence van Heygen

[PGW] calls and apologises.
	
	it was a serious attempt at cracking root.
	however, [TTSGD] is not a particularly clueful hacker
	the method was a well documented way, that won't work on UCCFS

	Q: any possibility of it being accidental?
	A: no way.

	Resolution:
		leave acct locked for 2 weeks as a punitive measure, or
		more/less as wheel's prerogative.
	
	[SAF] to check out acct and report to wheel and committee
